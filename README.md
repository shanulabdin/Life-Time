"# Life-Time" 
I started coding because of this app idea
I wanted to test what AI can do, so i just went on hostinger Horizons, told it what i want and it created an app, which calculates your life, there were so many features, i just kept adding features.
I was so amazed by its capability, but the code got messy very fast, and i didnt understand what was going on, and i wanted to understand whats happening, and i wanted to mak ethese kind of apps.
So i just asked chatGPT what languages i should learn, if my main goal is to make apps, both web apps and mobile apps, it told me to start with JS, so i just started practicing JS daily.
It was 25-june-2025, i have learned HTML CSS and JS since and i have built a game and few websites, im still learning.
So I'm just creating this app and i will learn what i need along the way, lets see how far i get.
